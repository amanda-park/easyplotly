# Plotly Python Repo

This repo has some Python functions that make creating interactive visualizations using the Plotly framework very simple. Currently, the functions included can handle the following:
* Scatter Plots
  * Marginal distributions for the scatter plots are included!
* Bar charts
  * These charts can adapt based on variables fed in to become histograms as well!
* Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Anomaly Detection graphs
  * Framework for Anomaly Detection can be found [here](https://bitbucket.spectrum-health.org:7991/stash/projects/QSE/repos/adtk/browse)
* Line charts


## Installation

The main pip install you will need to make is to add the plotly library to your environment:

```bash
pip install plotly

```
Then you can import the functions as needed for creating interactive visualizations.

## To-Do

* Convert to a class/OOP structure
