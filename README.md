# Plotly Python Repo

This repo has some Python functions that make creating interactive visualizations using the Plotly framework very simple. Currently, the functions included can handle the following:
* Scatter Plots
  * Marginal distributions for the scatter plots are included!
* Bar charts
  * These charts can adapt based on variables fed in to become histograms as well!
* Control Charts Formatted for ADTK
  * Anomaly Detection repo can be found [here](https://bitbucket.spectrum-health.org:7991/stash/projects/QSE/repos/adtk/browse)
* Line charts

This repo has an OOP/Class structure with documentation written in Sphinx (seen in the docs/ folder). 

## Installation

Install plotly to your Python environment:

```bash
pip install plotly
```
Then you can import the functions as needed for creating interactive visualizations.
